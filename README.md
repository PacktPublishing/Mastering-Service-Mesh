**Enhance, secure, and observe cloud-native applications with Istio, Linkerd, and Consul**

## What is this book about?
Although microservices-based applications support DevOps and continuous delivery, they can also add to the complexity of testing and observability. The implementation of a service mesh architecture, however, allows you to secure, manage, and scale your microservices more efficiently. With the help of practical examples, this book demonstrates how to install, configure, and deploy an efficient service mesh for microservices in a Kubernetes environment.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Manage your cloud-native applications easily using service mesh architecture
* Learn about Istio, Linkerd, and Consul – the three primary open source service mesh providers
* Explore tips, techniques, and best practices for building secure, high-performance microservices
